## Overview

Perclias is an innovative and promising project! Leveraging conversational AI to assist patients and healthcare professionals can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. By analyzing patient-doctor conversations and utilizing data-driven approaches, Perclias can provide personalized healthcare solutions, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations tailored to individual needs. This could significantly improve patient outcomes and streamline the healthcare process.

## Problem statement
● Inefficient Information Management: Manual capture and organization of patient-doctor conversations can be time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.

● Limited Personalization: Providing personalized healthcare recommendations based on individual patient symptoms and medical history is challenging, particularly in high-volume healthcare settings where time constraints are prevalent.

● Communication Barriers: Effective communication between patients and healthcare professionals is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, language barriers, medical jargon, and limited consultation time often impede this process, hindering the quality of care provided.
